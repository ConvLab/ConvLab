class OnPolicyReplay(Memory):
    '''
    Stores agent experiences and returns them in a batch for agent training.

    An experience consists of
        - state: representation of a state
        - action: action taken
        - reward: scalar value
        - next state: representation of next state (should be same as state)
        - done: 0 / 1 representing if the current state is the last in an episode

    The memory does not have a fixed size. Instead the memory stores data from N episodes, where N is determined by the user. After N episodes, all of the examples are returned to the agent to learn from.

    When the examples are returned to the agent, the memory is cleared to prevent the agent from learning from off policy experiences. This memory is intended for on policy algorithms.

    Differences vs. Replay memory:
        - Experiences are nested into episodes. In Replay experiences are flat, and episode is not tracked
        - The entire memory constitues a batch. In Replay batches are sampled from memory.
        - The memory is cleared automatically when a batch is given to the agent.

    e.g. memory_spec
    "memory": {
        "name": "OnPolicyReplay"
    }
