# Vanilla MLE Policy
Vanilla MLE Policy employs a multi-class classification with a shortlisted set of most frequent compositional actions where a compositional action consists of a set of dialog act items.

## Example usage
We based our implementation on the [AllenNLP library](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp). For an introduction to this library, you should check [these tutorials](https://allennlp.org/tutorials).

```bash
$ python train.py configs/300.jsonnet -s serialization_dir
$ python evaluate.py serialization_dir/model.tar.gz {test_file} --cuda-device {CUDA_DEVICE}
```

If you want to perform end-to-end evaluation, you can include the trained model by adding the model path (serialization_dir/model.tar.gz) to your ConvLab spec file.

## Data
We use the multiwoz data (data/multiwoz/[train|val|test.json.zip).
