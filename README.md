# ConvLab
ConvLab is an open-source multi-domain end-to-end dialog system platform, aiming to enable researchers to quickly set up experiments with reusable components and compare a large set of different approaches, ranging from conventional pipeline systems to end-to-end neural models, in common environments.

## Running ConvLab
Once you've downloaded ConvLab and installed required packages, you can run the command-line interface with the `python run.py` command.

```bash
$ python run.py {spec file} {spec name} {mode}
```

For example:
```bash
# to evaluate a dialog system consisting of NLU(OneNet), DST(Rule), Policy(Rule), NLG(Template) on the MultiWOZ environment
$ python run.py demo.json onenet_rule_rule_template eval

# to train a DQN policy with NLU(OneNet), DST(Rule), NLG(Template) on the MultiWOZ environment
$ python run.py demo.json onenet_rule_dqn_template train
```

## Creating a new spec file
A spec file is used to fully specify experiments including a dialog agent and a user simulator. It is a JSON of multiple experiment specs, each containing the keys agent, env, body, meta, search.

We based our implementation on [SLM-Lab](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/tree/master/slm_lab). For an introduction to these concepts, you should check [these docs](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/).

Instead of writing one from scratch, you are welcome to modify the `convlab/spec/demo.json` file. Once you have created a new spec file, place it under `convlab/spec` directory and run your experiments. Note that you don't have to prepend `convlab/spec/` before your spec file name.

## Contributions
The ConvLab team welcomes contributions from the community. Pull requests must have one approving review and no requested changes before they are merged. The ConvLab team reserve the right to reject or revert contributions that we don't think are good additions.
