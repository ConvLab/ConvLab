Tasktk documentation
==================================
This is a toolkit for developing task-oriented dialog system. We followed the classical pipeline framework, where there are 4 seperated components: NLU, DST, Policy and NLG.

We offered the base class and some SOTA baseline models (coming soon) for each component. Specially, the NLU, DST and NLG models are trained individually, while the Policy is trained within a complete pipeline model in a RL-based manner.
